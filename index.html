<h3>What we have learned:</h3>
<p style="text-align:center; ">- From the past 8 months of learning ICT 10, 
from first quarter to 4th quarter, we have learned the history of internet and how it started. 
We also learned the differences between HTML and CSS. Not only this, we also learned the 
advantages and disadvantages of using the internet. Those commonly used internet terms, 
area codes and parts of URL or web address. Also, how to create websites. Now, let us explain to you one-by-one those lessons
we have learned. We learned the history of Internet; did you know that the early internet was used
by engineers, computer experts, and librarians. It was first called as ARPANET and became functional
in 1969. Fast forward when ARPANET turn into the internet. It was followed by the invention of 
WORLD WIDE WEB also known as WWW, which was created in the early 1990's and it was lead by Tim
Berners-Lee. Followed by the development of HTML, HTTP, and URL's. Now, it became a large network of
computers that houses information on a multitude of subjects. The differences of HTML and CSS.
For HTML is a markup language used to create static web pages and web applications. CSS is a 
style sheet language responsible for the presentation of documents written in a markup language. 
The similarities both HTML and CSS are used to create and design web page.
We also learned that, In html we can create our own web pages, while CSS allows us to design the
html we created. Also I know the three advantages and disadvantages of the Internet, on the 
advantages here are: Access to Information - The internet provides instant access to a vast amount 
of information on virtually any topic, enabling learning and research. Communication - It facilitates
real-time communication through email, instant messaging, video conferencing, and social media, 
connecting people globally.Entertainment - It offers a wide range of entertainment options, including 
streaming services, online gaming, social media platforms, and digital content creation. And the
disadvantages are:Fake Information - Misinformation and fake news are rampant online, leading to 
confusion and misinformation. Addiction - Excessive internet usage can lead to addiction, affecting 
productivity and mental health. Distraction - The internet offers endless entertainment and 
distractions, which can hinder focus and productivity. We also learned commonly used internet terms, like
downloading, which transfer something you find from the internet to another device. Uploading, which is the 
transmission of a file from one computer system to another computer system. Also the convincing looking
emails and web pages is called phishing. Malicious software is called malware. Firewall is a term to describe
a barrier against destruction. Also, HTTPS is the security of the page, while HTTP is the most commnon protocol.
We also learned some parts of URL or Uniform Resource Locators. We have scheme, domain, subdomain, 
top-level domain, second-level domain, port, file path, parameter string, and anchor. In addition,
we also learned on how to properly use tags in each paragraph and what tags to put in each sentence that 
you put in a notepad or in a document and in each element of HTML and One of the things I learned is 
also about CSS or Cascading style sheets that each tag is the same as in HTML but only has something added to 
organize the document we will make and how to put a different color or how to put a color on background or 
the words we made. on how to create the site, like creating Html using the right properties that we discussed lately. Through the Process of HTML I have learned how to provides the basic structure of a webpage through elements such as headings, paragraphs, lists, and links. Also HERE ARE SOME EXAMPLES OF THE PROPERTIES:
background-color: purple
font-style: italic
text-color: black
font-size: 100cm
margin-bottom: 10px.
As a grade-10 student, it was a nice and unique experience to know how to use modern technologies. 
HTML - it contains the information that tells the browser what is on the page in terms of text, links, where to find images. Other very basic and common HTML tags include “strong”, for bolded content, and “i” or “em”, for italization.
CSS - is used to style and layout web pages — for example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features. A stylesheet language used in web design to control the layout and presentation of web pages. It's essential because it allows designers to customize the appearance of websites, making them visually appealing.
On how information is communicated and used in our digital world. This includes understanding how computers work, how data is stored and transmitted, how to use different software applications, and the role of technology in our daily lives. Like, topics can range from basic computer skills, digital literacy, data management, internet usage, to more advanced areas like programming, web development, and network management.
On the other hand, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a specific skill within the broader ICT field. It's a language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in HTML.
the proper ways of creating HTML example like 
document type declaration start your HTML document with the < ! DOCTYPE html >
second is HTML structure wrap your entire HTML content with html tag
third is head section contains meta-information about the documents
fourth is title tag with the head section to define the title of your Web page.
The body section contains the actual content of your webpage. Use HTML elements such as headings head one, head two, paragraphs symbolize p. Alternative text for images (alt attribute), and following accessibility guidelines.
for the last is you need to close the html like close tag html.
